<p>Tanu, I don’t know if I ever said this properly, but you’ve always been one of the prettiest and most genuinely beautiful people I’ve ever met ✨🙂.</p>

<p>From the very first time we met in Bikaner—playing pithhu with a basketball like total champs 😂🏀—to meeting again in Jodhpur and completing our 12th together… these memories always stay special to me.</p>

<p>Even though I didn’t talk much during school days (you know how I overthink what people might think 😅), life somehow brought us closer again. And honestly, I’m glad it did.</p>

<p>That one small reply on your Insta story turned into long chats, daily routine updates, school memories, late-night laughs and so much comfort between us 💛🙂.</p>

<p>It still feels crazy and special how our dads served together, and because of that, our lives crossed again.</p>

<p>And the last time we met at the unit’s Raising Day… damn, you looked absolutely gorgeous in that sharara ✨💫.</p>

<p>Tanu, our friendship means a lot to me—more than you know. It’s precious, and I genuinely want it to stay the same… actually, even stronger with time 🤝🙂💛.</p>

<p>Thanks for being such an amazing part of my life.</p>
